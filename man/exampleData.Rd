exampleData was obtained from a dataset downloaded from NCBI GEO (GSE224705),
that contains lupus patients treated with Micophenolate mofetil. The same
preprocessing was done as for the datasets used to create refData. 40
patients were randomly selected, 20 samples from responding patients and 20
from non-responders.
